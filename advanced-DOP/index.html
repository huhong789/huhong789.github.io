        As control-flow hijacking defenses gain adoption,
        it is important to understand the remaining capabilities of
        adversaries via memory exploits. Non-control data exploits are
        used to mount information leakage attacks or corrupt a few bytes
        of program memory. The common understanding is that such ex-
        ploits have limited expressiveness; however, the question is: what
        is the real expressive power of non-control data attacks? In this
        paper we show that such attacks are Turing-complete. We present
        a systematic technique called <i>data-oriented programming (DOP)</i> to 
        to construct expressive non-control data exploits for arbitrary
        x86 programs. In the experimental evaluation using 9 programs,
        we identified 7518 data-oriented x86 gadgets and 5052 gadget
        dispatchers which are the building blocks for DOP. 8 out of 9 real-world 
        programs have gadgets to simulate arbitrary computations
        and 2 of them are confirmed to be able to build Turing-complete
        attacks. We build 3 end-to-end attacks to bypass randomization
        defenses without leaking addresses, to run a network bot which
        takes commands from the attacker, and to alter the memory
        permissions. All the attacks work in the presence of ASLR
        and DEP, demonstrating how the expressiveness offered by DOP
        significantly empowers the attacker.<p>
        
        The work will be presented at the 37th IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy in May 2016 
        (<a href="http://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2016/">IEEE S&P 2016</a>).

            <b>DOP</b>. We propose <i>data-oriented programming (DOP)</i>, a general method to build Turing-complete non-control data
            attacks against vulnerable programs. We propose concrete methods to identify data-oriented gadgets, gadget
            dispatchers and a search strategy to stitch these gadgets. <br> <br>
            <b>Prevalence</b>. Our evaluation of 9 real world applications	shows that programs do have a large number (1273) of 
            data-oriented gadgets reachable from real-world vulnerabilities, which are required by data-oriented programming
            operations. <br> <br>
            <b>Practicality</b>. We show that Turing-complete non-control data exploits for common memory errors are practical.
            8 out of 9 applications provide data-oriented gadgets to build Turing-complete attacks. We build 3 end-to-end
            non-control data exploits which work even in the presence of DEP and ASLR, demonstrating the effectiveness of
            data-oriented programming. <br>
